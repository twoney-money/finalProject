#Me and Aaron will be working on making a side scroller shooter boss fight with a ship shooting lasers and maybe power ups
    #A very simple vision of what our game will look like (but in space with other different things)
        #https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxcCoDlnqr4
#Our first major milestone would be to make a working ship that can move and shoot the laser
#I will need to learn how to use pygame's formating and library with what know on classes to make the code
#My project might to ambitious in that the power ups might take more time then expected to make and the boss might be too difficult to make intresting and fun
#I don't see that there are many parts to this project that are not ambitious enough
